##  Requirements

*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89` .
*   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl` .
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   You are not allowed to use global variables.
*   No more than 5 functions per file.
*   You are not allowed to use the standard library unless stated otherwise. Any use of functions like  `printf`, `puts`, etc… is forbidden.
*   You are allowed to use `_putchar`.
*   The `main.c` files are used to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo.
*   The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`.


## Project Description.
Learning about nested loops, functions and how to use them. Learn about prototypes and header files and how to use them with `#include`.

* **0. _putchar** - Write a program that prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line. - `0-putchar.c`.
* **1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game** - Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. - `1-alphabet.c`.
* **2. 10 x alphabet** - Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. - `2-print_alphabet_x10.c`.
* **3. islower** - Write a function that checks for lowercase character. - `3-islower.c`.
* **4. isalpha** - Write a function that checks for alphabetic character. -  `4-isalpha.c`.
* **5. Sign** - Write a function that prints the sign of a number. -  `5-sign.c`.
* **6. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you** - Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer. - `6-abs.c`.
* **7. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important** - Write a function that prints the last digit of a number. - `7-print_last_digit.c`.
* **8. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life** - Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from `00:00` to `23:59`. - `8-24_hours.c`.
* **9. Learn your times table** - Write a function that prints the `9` times table, starting with `0`. - `9-times_table.c`.
* **10. a + b** - Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result. -  `10-add.c`.
* **11. 98 Battery Street, the OG** - Write a function that prints all natural numbers from `n` to `98`, followed by a new line. -  `11-print_to_98.c`.
* **12. The World looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself** - Write a function that prints the `n` times table, starting with `0`. - `100-times_table.c`.
* **13. Nature made the natural numbers; All else is the work of women** -  Write a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of `3` or `5` below `1024` (excluded), followed by a new line. - `101-natural.c`.
* **14. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A** - Write a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with `1` and `2`, followed by a new line. - `102-fibonacci.c`.
* **15. Even Liber Abbaci** - By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, write a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms, followed by a new line. - `103-fibonacci.c`.
* **16. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A+** - Write a program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with `1` and `2`, followed by a new line. - `104-fibonacci.c`.
