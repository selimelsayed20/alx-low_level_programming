##  Requirements
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
*   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   You are not allowed to use global variables.
*   No more than 5 functions per file.
*   The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etc… is forbidden unless stated othewise.
*   You are allowed to use the following macros:`va_start`, `va_arg` and `va_end`.
*   You are allowed to use `_putchar`.
*   The `main.c` files are used to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo.
*   The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `function_pointers.h`.
*   All your header files should be include guarded.


## Project Description
Learn about what are variadic functions. How to use `va_start`, `va_arg` and `va_end` macros. Why and how to use the `const` type qualifier.

* **0. Beauty is variable, ugliness is constant** - Write a function that returns the sum of all its parameters. - `0-sum_them_all.c`.
* **1. To be is to be the value of a variable** - Write a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line. - `1-print_numbers.c`.
* **2. One woman's constant is another woman's variable** - Write a function that prints strings, followed by a new line. - `2-print_strings.c`.
* **3. To be is a to be the value of a variable** - Write a function that prints anything. - `3-print_all.c`.
